RawLogger (Garmin ConnectIQ) App
================================
Usage instructions


Controls
--------

Use the devices buttons to:
 - UP/DOWN: browse through enabled data (see Settings below)
 - SELECT:  start/stop(save) the Activity recording (to FIT file)
 - BACK:    add a Lap to the Activity (or exit the application)
 - MENU:    enter the Settings menu (when *not* recording an Activity)


Settings
--------

Enter the Settings by pressing the MENU button (long-pressing the UP button).

The main menu is divided in four sub-menus:
 - System:   ConnectIQ.System.Stats data fields (battery+memory)
 - Position: ConnectIQ.Position.Info data fields (all)
 - Sensor:   ConnectIQ.Sensor.Info data fields (all)
 - Activity: ConnectIQ.Activity.Info data fields (current)

Please read the ConnectIQ developer documentation to learn more about each
data class:
 - https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/monkey-c/doc/Toybox/System/Stats.html
 - https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/monkey-c/doc/Toybox/Position/Info.html
 - https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/monkey-c/doc/Toybox/Sensor/Info.html
 - https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/monkey-c/doc/Toybox/Activity/Info.html
As well as FIT-file "contributed" (custom) fields:
 - https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/monkey-c/doc/Toybox/FitContributor/Field.html

The enabled data fields will become browsable in the application (UP/DOWN
buttons) and will be recorded to the FIT-file once the Activity is started
(SELECT button).

High-definition (HD) data fields values will only become available once the
Activity has been started.

Please note that ConnectIQ enforces limits on FIT-files:
 - max. 16 data fields
 - max. 256 bytes accross all data fields
Enabled data fields that trespass those limits will be ignored.

The Settings menu may *not* be entered while the Activity has been started
and the FIT-file is being recorded.


Analyzing FIT files
-------------------

If only a few data fields are recorded in the FIT-file and only coarse analysis
is needed, you may visualize the data directly in Garmin Connect (website or
mobile), provided you downloaded RawLogger from the Garmin Store. Please note
that Garmin apparently imposes a limit on the quantity of custom data fields
that may be displayed in Garmin Connect.

If you need to perform a detailed analysis of the data (or recorded more data
fields tha Gamin Connect is willing to display), please use the FIT SDK:

1. Download and install (unzip) the FIT SDK

    https://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit/

2. Retrieve the FIT-file directly from your device or download/unzip it from
   Garmin Connect (Gear Icon -> Export Original)

    https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/<activity-ID>

3. Convert the FIT-file to CSV

    java -jar /path/to/FIT-SDK/java/FitCSVTool.jar -b <acivity-ID>.fit <activity-ID>.csv --data record

4. Open the CSV *data* file using LibreOffice Calc (or Microsoft Excel)

    /path/to/LibreOffice/program/soffice <activity-ID>_data.csv

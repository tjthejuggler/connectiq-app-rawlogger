RawLogger (Garmin ConnectIQ) App
================================
ConnectIQ raw data logger (for development/troubleshooting purposes)

RawLogger is as simple as it gets:

1. enable the data fields you want to see in the application and
   record to the Activity FIT-file (use the application Settings)

2. record the Activity (SELECT button to start/stop)

3. recover and analyze the corresponding FIT-file directly from
   the device or via Garmin Connect

**No processing of the displayed/recorded data takes place what-so-ever.**  
ConnectIQ System (Stats), Position, Sensor and/or Activity (Info) data are
directly stored in the Activity/FIT-file for later analysis.
